It runs on a catalogue of nearly 300,000 Portuguese-language editions. It is licensed AGPL-3.0. It was built in the open, in public, by an advertiser who is not a programmer, working in pairs with an AI agent.` },

      { t: 'p', html: `<strong>A rating that is a word.</strong> Adorei, gostei, achei ok, não gostei, não terminei. Never a number. A star is a scale, a scale becomes an average, an average becomes a scoreboard, and a scoreboard turns reading into a performance.` },
      { t: 'p', html: `<strong>A chronological feed, and a room to wander.</strong> The feed is only people you chose to follow, with nothing injected between them. And there's a separate tab to explore, full of shelves belonging to people you don't follow yet, shuffled rather than ranked. Discovery exists here. It just doesn't come find you.` },

No queue, no email, no "we're preparing your archive," which is friction dressed as care. <strong>And the CSV uses the Goodreads export columns</strong>, the format Skoob, StoryGraph, Oku and Fable already know how to read. An export is only an exit if another app can open it. A proprietary JSON nobody imports is a ransom note in a nice typeface.` },

          `<strong>The honour never falls, and it never looks at the clock.</strong> No "books this month," no seasons. Stopping for a year costs nothing. An app that drops your number when life gets hard is an app that punishes the grieving, the sick, and the person with a newborn, and it makes people open a thin book they don't like just to keep what was already theirs.`,
          `<strong>Abandoning costs nothing, and the rating doesn't count.</strong> Reading and hating is worth exactly what reading and loving is worth. If "adorei" were worth more, the app would be buying compliments. If quitting cost something, nobody would ever quit a bad book again.`,
          `<strong>No algorithmic feed.</strong> Nothing is ranked and nothing is injected. Your feed is the people you chose, in the order it happened. And when you want strangers, there's a tab for that, shuffled rather than sorted. Discovery you walk into is a different object from discovery that walks into you.`,

So yes, a thing that goes up when you read more exists in a product that says reading is not a performance.` },
      { t: 'p', html: `What we did was strip the ladder of every part that makes a number cruel. It has no leaderboard, so there is nobody to beat. It never falls, so quitting for a year costs nothing. It never looks at the clock, so there's no month and no season. It can't be sorted, so it can't be a ranking. What's left is a slow shape of your life as a reader, visible only to you and the people who already know you.` },

If you think we got the trade wrong, that argument belongs in an issue, and it will get a real answer.` },

Erased from a library because a file went unread.` },

      { t: 'p', html: `So the scarce resource is not code. It is the question asked before the write. It is knowing that a shared record is not yours to overwrite. It is noticing that a vendor's key is provenance, not identity, because Open Library has three different keys for Tolstoy and none of them is him.` },

          `<strong>Authorization lives in exactly one file</strong>, and a script breaks the build if a check appears anywhere else. Not a convention. A gate.`,
          `<strong>There are more than 700 tests, and the important ones don't test functions. They scan the codebase.</strong> One breaks the build if a screen starts speaking like a developer ("schema", "endpoint", "Phase 4"), because Gume talks to readers. One breaks if a route is born public without anyone deciding it. One breaks if a badge could ever be earned by <em>reading</em>, or if one badge glows brighter than another. One bans a timezone-naive date function everywhere except the file allowed to have it, because that bug once filed a book under the wrong year. And a red team attacks the system, swapping UUIDs to try to read and write another person's rows.`,
